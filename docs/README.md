# praeco

`praeco` provides Python clients for working with remote services used to
publish, upload, query, and manage research and semantic assets.

The main user-facing API is built around service clients:

- `OntodockerClient` for Ontodocker-backed RDF datasets, endpoint discovery, and
  SPARQL queries.
- `DataportalClient` for datasets, assets, DCAT RDF, and SPARQL workflows on the
  [MaterialDigital Dataportal](https://dataportal.material-digital.de).
- `ZenodoClient` for Zenodo depositions, files, metadata, license lookup, and
  publication workflows.

`HttpClient` is the shared HTTP(S) base client used by service clients. Advanced
users may also use it directly when they need low-level access to an HTTP API or
want to prototype support for a new service.

`praeco` is not a workflow engine, scheduler, triple store, or archival backend.
It is a client layer for talking to those services through explicit Python APIs.

## Overview

The public API is organized in two layers.

Service clients implement domain workflows:

- `OntodockerClient` exposes `endpoints`, `datasets`, and `sparql` resources.
- `DataportalClient` exposes `datasets`, `assets`, `rdf`, and `sparql` resources.
- `ZenodoClient` exposes `depositions`, `files`, and `licenses` resources.

Protocol clients provide reusable transport behavior:

- `HttpClient` normalizes base URLs, manages bearer-token headers, handles
  timeouts and TLS verification, and provides small request/response helpers.

New user code should usually start with a service client. Use `HttpClient`
directly only when a service-specific method does not exist yet, or when you are
developing a new service adapter.

## Installation

`praeco` supports Python 3.11 to 3.13. Development in this repository currently
targets Python 3.12.

For local use or development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyiron/praeco.git
cd praeco
conda create -n praeco python=3.12
conda activate praeco
pip install -e .
```

If you want the documentation environment as well, see `docs/environment.yml`.

PyPI and conda-forge releases are planned, but the current hands-on installation
path is an editable install from the repository.

## Service Clients

Service clients are the primary API for normal use. They subclass or build on
`HttpClient`, then attach small resource objects for service-specific behavior.
Generic transport code stays in `praeco/http_client.py` and
`praeco/transport/`; service-specific routes, models, and error handling live
under `praeco/services/<service>/`.

### OntodockerClient

`OntodockerClient` is the service-specific client for Ontodocker datasets,
endpoint discovery, and SPARQL queries.

#### Architecture

An `OntodockerClient` exposes three resource objects:

```python
from praeco import OntodockerClient

client = OntodockerClient("ontodocker.example.org", token="your-token")

client.endpoints
client.datasets
client.sparql
```

These resources share the same transport configuration: bearer-token
authentication, timeout handling, TLS verification, and request execution come
from `HttpClient`.

Endpoint discovery also contains Ontodocker-specific compatibility logic for
historical endpoint URL formats. That behavior belongs to the Ontodocker service
package rather than the generic transport layer.

#### Basic Usage

For notebooks or scripts, configure the service URL and optional token in the
environment:

```bash
export ONTODOCKER_ADDRESS="https://ontodocker.example.org"
export ONTODOCKER_TOKEN="..."
```

Create a client:

```python
import os

from praeco import OntodockerClient

client = OntodockerClient(
    address=os.environ["ONTODOCKER_ADDRESS"],
    token=os.getenv("ONTODOCKER_TOKEN") or None,
)
```

Discover available endpoints and datasets:

```python
raw_endpoints = client.endpoints.list_raw()
endpoints = client.endpoints.list()
datasets = client.datasets.list()
```

Create a disposable dataset, upload Turtle, and fetch it again:

```python
from pathlib import Path

dataset = "praeco_demo"
turtle_path = Path("demo.ttl")
turtle_path.write_text(
    """
@prefix ex: <https://example.org/> .

ex:sample ex:label "Praeco demo sample" .
""".strip()
    + "\n",
    encoding="utf-8",
)

client.datasets.create(dataset)
client.datasets.upload_turtlefile(dataset, turtle_path)

turtle_text = client.datasets.fetch_turtle(dataset)
downloaded = client.datasets.download_turtle(dataset, "downloaded_demo.ttl")
```

Upload an in-memory `rdflib.Graph`:

```python
import rdflib

graph = rdflib.Graph()
EX = rdflib.Namespace("https://example.org/")

graph.add((EX.sample2, EX.label, rdflib.Literal("Graph-created sample")))
client.datasets.upload_graph(dataset, graph)
```

Run SPARQL queries:

```python
query = """
SELECT ?s ?p ?o
WHERE {
  ?s ?p ?o .
}
LIMIT 10
"""

raw_result = client.sparql.query_raw(dataset, query)
df = client.sparql.query_df(dataset, query, columns=["s", "p", "o"])
```

Clean up disposable resources when finished:

```python
client.datasets.delete(dataset)
turtle_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)
Path(downloaded).unlink(missing_ok=True)
```

#### More Information

Use `OntodockerClient` for dataset, endpoint, and SPARQL workflows. Use
`HttpClient` directly only when you need an endpoint that the Ontodocker
resources do not expose yet. If that endpoint becomes part of normal Ontodocker
usage, add it as a method on an Ontodocker resource class instead of duplicating
URL construction in notebooks or scripts.

See the
[OntodockerClient notebook](https://github.com/pyiron/praeco/blob/main/notebooks/OntodockerClient.ipynb)
for a runnable demo and more detailed usage.

### DataportalClient

`DataportalClient` supports publication and semantic-data workflows on the
CKAN-backed [MaterialDigital Dataportal](https://dataportal.material-digital.de).
It uses the Dataportal deployment by default, while still allowing another
compatible address to be supplied explicitly.

#### Architecture

A `DataportalClient` exposes four resource objects:

```python
from praeco import DataportalClient

client = DataportalClient(api_token="your-token")

client.datasets
client.assets
client.rdf
client.sparql
```

The client builds on praeco's shared HTTP and CKAN transport infrastructure.
The resource objects provide typed dataset and asset operations, DCAT RDF
retrieval, and discovery and querying of dataset-associated SPARQL endpoints.

#### Basic Usage

Provide a Dataportal API token through the environment:

```bash
export DATAPORTAL_TOKEN="..."
```

Create a client:

```python
import os

from praeco import DataportalClient

client = DataportalClient(api_token=os.environ["DATAPORTAL_TOKEN"])
```

Service-independent publication fields are modeled with
`PublicationMetadata`. Wrap them in `DataportalMetadata` to add CKAN and
Dataportal-specific fields before creating a dataset:

```python
from praeco import Person, PublicationMetadata
from praeco.services.dataportal import DataportalMetadata

publication = PublicationMetadata(
    title="praeco Dataportal example",
    description="Example dataset created with praeco.",
    creators=[Person(name="Example Author")],
    keywords=["praeco", "dataportal"],
)
metadata = DataportalMetadata(
    metadata=publication,
    name="praeco-dataportal-example",
    owner_org="organization-id",
    private=True,
)

dataset = client.datasets.create(metadata)
```

Upload Turtle using a format recognized by the Dataportal's Fuseki integration:

```python
from pathlib import Path

asset = client.assets.upload_rdf(
    dataset,
    Path("dataset.ttl"),
    format="turtle",
)
```

The Dataportal performs triplestore updates asynchronously. Once Fuseki indexing
has completed and the generated SPARQL resource is available, query it through
the dataset model:

```python
dataset = client.datasets.show(dataset)
endpoint = client.sparql.endpoint(dataset)
result = client.sparql.query_json(
    endpoint,
    "ASK WHERE { ?subject ?predicate ?object }",
)
```

#### More Information

Creating datasets and starting Fuseki updates require suitable permissions for
the selected organization. Use disposable private datasets when validating
write workflows against the live deployment, and clean them up afterwards.

See the
[DataportalClient notebook](https://github.com/pyiron/praeco/blob/main/notebooks/DataportalClient.ipynb)
for a complete live workflow covering organization discovery, metadata,
datasets, RDF assets, Fuseki indexing, SPARQL querying, and cleanup.

### ZenodoClient

`ZenodoClient` is the service-specific client for Zenodo deposition drafts,
file uploads, metadata authoring, license lookup, and publication actions.

#### Architecture

A `ZenodoClient` exposes three resource objects:

```python
from praeco import ZenodoClient

client = ZenodoClient(sandbox=True, token="your-sandbox-token")

client.depositions
client.files
client.licenses
```

`client.depositions` owns draft and publication lifecycle operations such as
creating drafts, setting metadata, publishing, editing, discarding edits,
creating new versions, and deleting unpublished drafts.

`client.files` owns draft-file operations such as listing, uploading, renaming,
and deleting files. File uploads use the bucket link returned by Zenodo.

`client.licenses` provides read-only lookup of Zenodo license metadata.

The current draft/deposition implementation uses Zenodo's legacy deposition API.
This is the Zenodo-specific API still used for the core create, upload, update,
and publish workflow implemented here. A future migration toward the newer
InvenioRDM REST API is expected, but the existing resource surface is kept
stable until there is a tested migration path.

#### Basic Usage

For development and testing, use the Zenodo sandbox:

```bash
export ZENODO_SANDBOX_TOKEN="..."
```

Sandbox and production Zenodo have separate accounts and tokens. A sandbox token
must come from `https://sandbox.zenodo.org`, not production Zenodo.

Create a client and a small artifact:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

from praeco import Person, PublicationMetadata, ZenodoClient
from praeco.services.zenodo import Creator, ZenodoMetadata

client = ZenodoClient(sandbox=True, token=os.environ["ZENODO_SANDBOX_TOKEN"])

artifact = Path("demo_artifact.txt")
artifact.write_text(
    "Hello from praeco's Zenodo sandbox demo.\n",
    encoding="utf-8",
)
```

Build service-independent publication metadata and wrap it in the Zenodo
adapter:

```python
publication = PublicationMetadata(
    title="praeco Zenodo sandbox demo",
    description="Small demonstration upload created with praeco.",
    creators=[
        Person(
            family_name="Doe",
            given_names="Jane",
            affiliation="Example Institute",
        )
    ],
    keywords=["praeco", "zenodo", "sandbox"],
    license="cc-by-4.0",
    version="0.1.0",
)

metadata = ZenodoMetadata.software(publication)
```

Directly setting publication fields such as `title`, `creators`, or `keywords`
on `ZenodoMetadata` is deprecated. Use `PublicationMetadata` for reusable
publication fields and `ZenodoMetadata` for Zenodo-specific fields.

The deprecated direct style still works temporarily for migration:

```python
metadata = ZenodoMetadata.software()
metadata.title = "praeco Zenodo sandbox demo"
metadata.description = "Small demonstration upload created with praeco."
metadata.license = "cc-by-4.0"
metadata.creators.append(
    Creator(
        family_name="Doe",
        given_names="Jane",
        affiliation="Example Institute",
    )
)
```

Create an unpublished draft, pre-reserve a DOI, upload the artifact, and set the
metadata:

```python
draft = client.depositions.create(prereserve_doi=True)
uploaded = client.files.upload(draft, artifact)
draft = client.depositions.set_metadata(draft, metadata)
```

Publishing is an explicit action:

```python
# published = client.depositions.publish(draft)
```

For routine demos, leave drafts unpublished and clean them up:

```python
client.depositions.delete(draft)
artifact.unlink(missing_ok=True)
```

Production Zenodo should be treated differently from the sandbox. Publishing on
production Zenodo creates a real archival record; a DOI becomes a persistent,
citable scholarly identifier when the record is published.

#### Metadata

`PublicationMetadata` is praeco's service-independent authoring model for
publication fields such as title, description, creators, contributors, related
identifiers, keywords, license, DOI, version, language, and publication date.

`ZenodoMetadata` adapts `PublicationMetadata` into Zenodo's API payload shape and
keeps Zenodo-specific fields such as upload type, access control, communities,
grants, DOI reservation, and notes.

Convenience constructors set the upload type:

```python
software = ZenodoMetadata.software(publication)
dataset = ZenodoMetadata.dataset(publication)
article = ZenodoMetadata.publication("article", publication)
image = ZenodoMetadata.image("figure", publication)
```

Common nested metadata is modeled independently of Zenodo:

- `Person` for creators and contributor identities.
- `Contributor` for additional contributors with a role.
- `RelatedIdentifier` for related persistent identifiers or URLs.

Zenodo-specific repeated metadata still uses Zenodo helpers:

- `CommunityRef` for Zenodo community identifiers.
- `GrantRef` for grant references.

`ZenodoMetadata.to_api_dict()` returns the inner Zenodo metadata object:

```python
metadata_object = metadata.to_api_dict()
```

`ZenodoMetadata.to_payload()` wraps that object as `{"metadata": ...}`, which is
the shape used by Zenodo deposition create and update requests:

```python
request_payload = metadata.to_payload()
```

The typed model performs local validation for stable structural rules before a
request is sent, such as required title, description, creator, access, and
license fields.

Plain `PublicationMetadata` is not passed directly to `client.depositions`.
Wrap it in `ZenodoMetadata` so the Zenodo upload type and service-specific
validation remain explicit.

For Zenodo fields that are documented but not yet modeled by `ZenodoMetadata`,
pass a raw mapping. Raw mappings are wrapped as `{"metadata": ...}` by
`client.depositions.create()` and `client.depositions.set_metadata()`, but they
do not receive praeco's local metadata validation:

```python
raw_metadata = metadata.to_api_dict()
raw_metadata["references"] = [
    "Doe J. (2026). Example reference for a sandbox upload. DOI:10.0000/example",
]

draft = client.depositions.set_metadata(draft, raw_metadata)
```

Server responses use `DepositionInfo`. Its `metadata` field remains a raw
dictionary because Zenodo may return normalized values or fields outside
praeco's authoring model.

#### Sandbox vs Production

Zenodo sandbox is for testing API workflows, metadata, uploads, DOI reservation,
and publication behavior. Sandbox records use test DOI infrastructure and should
not be cited as persistent scholarly records. Sandbox data may also be reset.

Production Zenodo is the real publication environment. Published production
records are archival research outputs, and their DOIs are persistent scholarly
identifiers. Use `ZenodoClient(sandbox=True, ...)` for development and switch to
the default production target only when publication is intentional.

#### More Information

Useful token scopes:

- `deposit:write` for creating drafts, updating metadata, and uploading files.
- `deposit:actions` for publishing, editing, discarding edits, and creating new
  versions.

Zenodo API failures raise `ZenodoApiError` or a more specific subclass such as
`ZenodoValidationError`, `ZenodoAuthenticationError`, `ZenodoPermissionError`,
or `ZenodoNotFoundError`. Local metadata and input validation failures use
`praeco.exceptions.ValidationError`.

See the
[ZenodoClient notebook](https://github.com/pyiron/praeco/blob/main/notebooks/ZenodoClient.ipynb)
for a sandbox demo and more detailed usage.

## Protocol Clients

Protocol clients provide lower-level infrastructure for service clients and
advanced use.

### HttpClient

`HttpClient` is the generic HTTP(S) client and base class for HTTP-backed
service clients.

#### Architecture

`HttpClient` centralizes shared transport behavior:

- normalizing a host or URL into `base_url`
- configuring bearer-token authorization headers
- passing timeout and TLS verification settings to `requests`
- allowing an externally managed `requests.Session`
- exposing helpers for common text and JSON request patterns
- raising consistent praeco HTTP errors

Developers adding a new HTTP-based service client should usually put domain
methods on small resource classes and let the service client inherit from or
compose `HttpClient`.

#### Basic Usage

Create a client:

```python
from praeco import HttpClient

client = HttpClient("api.example.org", token="initial-token")
client.base_url
```

Use `default_scheme="http"` for local development services without TLS:

```python
local = HttpClient("localhost:8000", default_scheme="http")
```

Token updates keep the session authorization header in sync:

```python
client.token = "rotated-token"
client.token = None
```

Use convenience helpers when the response shape is simple:

```python
json_payload = client.get_json("https://api.example.org/status")
text_payload = client.get_text("https://api.example.org/version")

created = client.post_text(
    "https://api.example.org/items",
    json={"name": "demo"},
)
updated = client.put_text(
    "https://api.example.org/items/demo",
    json={"name": "demo"},
)
deleted = client.delete_text("https://api.example.org/items/demo")
```

Use `request()` when you need direct access to the underlying
`requests.Response`:

```python
response = client.request(
    "GET",
    "https://api.example.org/status",
    headers={"Accept": "application/json"},
)
```

#### More Information

Use `HttpClient` directly when:

- an implemented service client does not expose the endpoint you need
- you are prototyping support for a new service
- the API is small enough that a full service client would not yet pay off

Once route construction, response parsing, or workflow logic starts repeating,
move that behavior into a service-specific client under `praeco/services/`.

See the
[HttpClient notebook](https://github.com/pyiron/praeco/blob/main/notebooks/HttpClient.ipynb)
for a runnable demonstration of the transport API.

## Developer Guide

The repository is organized by responsibility:

- `praeco/http_client.py` contains the public reusable HTTP client.
- `praeco/transport/` contains generic transport helpers for authentication,
  session creation, URL normalization/composition, and response handling.
- `praeco/services/ontodocker/` contains Ontodocker routes, resources, models,
  and compatibility helpers.
- `praeco/services/dataportal/` contains Dataportal datasets, assets, metadata,
  DCAT RDF, SPARQL, and CKAN-backed models.
- `praeco/services/zenodo/` contains Zenodo routes, resources, metadata
  authoring objects, response models, and Zenodo-specific errors.
- `tests/unit/` contains focused behavior tests using fake sessions and
  responses where practical.
- `tests/integration/` contains integration-oriented checks, including the
  README doctest loader.
- `notebooks/` contains runnable demos for the public clients.
- `.notes/` may contain local planning or investigation notes. Treat these as
  internal working material, not automatically user-facing documentation.

Keep generic behavior generic. URL normalization, authentication header
handling, request execution, and general response helpers belong in transport
code. Service routes, service models, compatibility behavior, and
service-specific exceptions belong under the corresponding service package.

When a workflow becomes normal user behavior, prefer adding a resource method
over repeating low-level URL construction in notebooks or application code.

## Development And Validation

Run commands from the project root.

Format with Black:

```bash
black .
```

Sort imports with Ruff:

```bash
ruff check --select I --fix .
```

Inspect broader Ruff suggestions before applying them:

```bash
ruff check --fix --diff .
```

Run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

`docs/README.md` is the package README and is loaded by
`tests/integration/test_readme.py` as a doctest file. Keep README examples either
simple enough to execute locally or formatted as illustrative fenced code blocks
without doctest prompts when they require external services.
